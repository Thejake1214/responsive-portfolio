        <p>My name is Jacob Boyett, or Jake for short. I was born in Houston texas on December 14th of 1994. Some of my favorite hobbies are skating, making or listening to music, and of course going out with friends.

        <p>I have been skating since I was about 6 years old thanks to my Dad. He was a big skater and surfer back when he was my age. My favorite part about skating is definitely when you finally get the trick you have been trying to do for so long. My least favorite would have to be when I fall flat on my face.

        <p>When it comes to me making music, it all started when I was in the 5th grade. That's when I learned how to play the saxophone and I have been doing it ever since. I haven't played my sax in quite a while but my friend Tyler and I like to make music in his studio. They're normally some sort of hip-hop beats but of course I always have to incorporate some saxophone in there just because its what I know and love.
